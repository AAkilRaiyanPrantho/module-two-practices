        “Wel-l-l-l,” the Baron said. He hesitated, drawing in a deep breath. He
        knew he had spoken too loudly. This moment, long-envisioned, had lost
        some of its savor. Damn that cursed doctor through all eternity! “I
        believe the good Duke is drugged,” Piter said. “That’s how Yueh caught
        him for us.” Piter turned to the Duke. “Aren’t you drugged, my dear
        Duke?” The voice was far away. Leto could feel the chains, the ache of
        muscles, his cracked lips, his burning cheeks, the dry taste of thirst
        whispering its grit in his mouth. But sounds were dull, hidden by a
        cottony blanket.

        They were words through a cottony blanket, but some of them burned in
        Leto’s mind. Woman and boy—nosign. Paul and Jessica had escaped. And the
        fate of Hawat, Halleck, and Idaho remained an unknown. There was still
        hope. “Where is the ducal signet ring?” the Baron demanded. “His finger
        is bare.” “The Sardaukar say it was not on him when he was taken, my
        Lord,” the guard captain said.

        “You killed the doctor too soon,” the Baron said. “That was a mistake.
        You should’ve warned me, Piter. You moved too precipitately for the good
        of our enterprise.” He scowled. “Possibilities!” The thought hung like a
        sine wave in Leto’s mind: Paul and Jessica have escaped! And there was
        something else in his memory: a bargain. He could amost remember it.

      <p>
        There was a table. Leto saw the table quite clearly. And a gross, fat
        man on the other side of the table, the remains of a meal in front of
        him. Leto felt himself sitting in a chair across from the fat man, felt
        the chains, the straps that held his tingling body in the chair. He was
        aware there had been a passage of time, but its length escaped him.

        Leto watched the moving hand, fascinated by it. “You can hear me, Duke
        Leto,” the Baron said. “I know you can hear me. We want to know from you
        where to find your concubine and the child you sired on her.”
