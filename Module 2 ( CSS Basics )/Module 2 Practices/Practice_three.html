        I have traveled many times with my family. I have traveled by flight, by
        train, etc. But the most exciting one was when I was traveling to Mumbai
        with my family. The plan to visit Mumbai was made just to have a great
        time by train. There was no specific reason to travel or visit Mumbai
        but the train journey is so fascinating for us that we decided to travel
        by train. We just spent three days in Mumbai and had a great time
        shopping but we spent 5 days traveling by train. A train journey can
        never be compared with any other journey or any other excitement.
        Traveling by flight would just take a few hours and it is the fastest
        means to travel and saves a lot of time. But at times, we just miss our
        train journeys, we miss the continuous calls of the stall vendors
        shouting biryani, chai… garam chai…, bread omelette, etc. When we miss
        the train journeys, this chorus would just bounce in our ears. The train
        would pass through the villages, forests, seas, rivers, etc. This makes
        the train journey so exciting because we meet nature closely.While
        traveling from one place to the other by train, we get in contact with
        different people. We make new friends, the children enjoy the most, and
        there are a lot of memories. It is so hard to control our cravings while
        traveling by train. We would rush to a food stall and buy any food, and
        parents would not even stop us.
